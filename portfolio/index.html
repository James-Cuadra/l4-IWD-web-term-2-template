                <h2>The Benefits of Cucumbers</h2>
                <p>
                    With an interest in food and nutrition since a young age, I have always been fascinated with the
                    varying
                    opinions surrounding <em>"superfoods"</em> and their supposed benefits when included in a diet. As I
                    got
                    older, I naturally formed my own opinions around the matter and settled on the following;
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    the real superfood is the Cucumber</blockquote>
                <p>
                    I realise this may come across as a controversial statement for the majority of readers, so let me
                    explain my reasoning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cucumber (<em>Cucumis sativus</em>) is a creeping vine plant belonging to the gourd family, a
                    family including sqaushes and melons. The cucumber's fruit is widely believed to be a vegetable,
                    however this is far from the truth. The cucumber is classified as a <b>modified berry</b>, with a
                    thick outer rind and no internal divisions, similar to a melon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cucumber is predominantly a carbohydrate, but with 95% of it's mass comprised of water it is
                    lower in calorie than most other carbs. The other 5% of it's mass is mainly the rind, containing
                    natural sugars and trace amounts of protein. However, the beauty of the cucumber comes not from it's
                    macronutrients, but its micronutrients.
                </p>
                <p>According to <a
                        href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/7-health-benefits-of-cucumber#TOC_TITLE_HDR_2">Healthline</a>
                    300g serving of cucumber contains the following micronutrients;</p>

                            <p>Cucumbers can be served in slices of varying thickness to add visual appeal to dishes and
                                to cater to different preferences. Thin slices of cucumber add a refreshing crunch to
                                salads and sandwiches, while thicker slices can be used as a base for dips or as a tasty
                                garnish for cocktails. One benefit of serving cucumbers in slices of varying thickness
                                is that it allows for more versatility in the kitchen. However, it's important to keep
                                in mind that thicker slices may take longer to soften and may not be as pleasing to some
                                palates.</p>

                            <p>Cucumbers can be served in batons, which are long, thin slices. This is a common way to
                                serve cucumbers in salads and as a garnish for drinks. One benefit of serving cucumbers
                                in batons is that they add a refreshing crunch to dishes. However, cucumbers can also
                                release a lot of water when cut, which can make dishes soggy if not served promptly. To
                                prevent this, it is best to slice the cucumbers just before serving or pat them dry
                                before adding them to a dish. Overall, serving cucumbers in batons adds visual appeal
                                and a refreshing crunch to dishes.</p>

                                into thin strips for a crunchy snack, cucumbers offer a host of nutritional benefits.
                                They are low in calories and high in hydration, making them a great choice for those
